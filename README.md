## What is this?
This program takes a PDF input and can output the text to the console for copying, .txt files, or .md files.

### Why does this help?
If you need to type the text from a PDF, this program may not be perfect, but formatting something that is close to the PDF is faster (and better in my opinion) than typing out the whole PDF.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/hussein-esmail7/pdf2text
cd pdf2text/
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Requirements
To run this program, you will need to have Python 3 installed, and install the required libraries from pip (using `requirements.txt`).

## Usage 
```
python3 pdf2text.py
```

This program takes 0 arguments, and uses the `pick` library to ask for options.

### Output Methods
When outputting, the program will ask if you want to print to console, save as Plain Text file, or save as Markdown file.

## TODO
- Add `copy to clipboard` output method
- Add `LaTeX` output method
